# Best-FE-Take-Home

## Overview of Solution

I have built this task management app with Javascript, React, and Material-UI. It is a CRUD application that allows users to create tasks with a title, priority, status, and other custom fields. Users are also able to filter and sort their tasks.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

1. **Assumptions:**
   - Users will only interact with the app on mouse and keyboard.
   - I am allowed to copy and paste the mockData directly in the code as a json file.
   - If users cancel an interaction, such as create task or edit task, the state should be persisted.


2. **Design Decisions:**
   - I used MUI components to speed up the development process and to keep the styling consistent.
   - The state is managed with react hooks.
   - The app is broken down into reusable and easy to maintain components.
   - I used Javascript with PropTypes over Typescript due to project size.

## Bonus Milestones Implemented

I didn't make it to the bonus milestones.

## Interesting Things to Know

1. **Error Checking:** I've implemented error checking throughout the input dialogs to ensure that users aren't able to add tasks without titles, add custom fields without types, etc.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
